# NodeJS-Starter-Kit
_Made by Luciano Nooijen_
Version 1.0.0 (still in development)

## Why this starter kit?
I created this starter kit for all of my NodeJS projects to save time on setting everything up. Because of this the workflow can be different from what you're used to, for example, I like to use CodeKit for small projects instead of Gulp or similar tools. You can of course change the the complete workflow to suit your needs. This is also the reason why I chose ejs and not pug for example. If you are looking for a custom boiler plate with Angular or React of some sort, of a more complete starter kit, check out [Mega Boiler Plate](http://megaboilerplate.com/), it's great!

## Installation
This starter keed requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run (duh).
```sh
$ npm install
```
```sh
$ npm nodemon
```

### Dependencies
* body-parser
* ejs
* express
* express-validator
* mongojs
* nodemon

## Features I am still working on (kind of a to do list for myself too)
* A form that you can use
* Better styling, some more elements
* I might add some more pages, like about us, services, contact, etc.
* True MVC structure, not just the views
* Better routing system, easier to setup
* Maybe a login feature, although I am not sure yet about that
* Some sort of backend panel would be nice with a couple of options
* MongoDB/MongoJS(/MySQL) integration
* I might add a blog function to the starter kit
* I might add a Gulp file so there is a choice between Gulp and CodeKit
* Integration of React/Angular/Vue, but I am still thinking about which
* Maybe I will add Typescript integration, but I'm not sure yet
